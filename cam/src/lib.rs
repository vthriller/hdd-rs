/*!
Thin wrapper against FreeBSD's libcam.

This module is not intended to be a full-featured wrapper even for a subset of all the things that libcam provides.
Instead, this module offers a number of helpers and shortcuts, like `impl Drop`, that should aid with writing a bit more concise and idiomatic code against libcam.
Users of this module are expected to do most of the things on their own, manually, using things like `unsafe {}` and `.0`.

This module is not for a general use. Besides the fact that it is utterly incomplete and unfriendly, this binding also lacks a lot of things that libcam provides, as they are irrelevant to the purposes of the crate.
For the list of exported FFI interfaces, consult `/build.rs`.
